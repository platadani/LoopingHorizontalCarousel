#### [Swift Package Manager][SPM]
Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the Swift compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding LoopingHorizontalCarousel as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```Swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/platadani/LoopingHorizontalCarousel.git", branch(“main”))
]
```
